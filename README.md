In the arena of medical imaging, computer vision has emerged as a diverting force, transforming the way diagnostic data is interpreted. One such application employs advanced image processing techniques to deliver precise tumor segmentation from 2D MRI scans. This innovative approach is facilitated by a Python-oriented graphical user interface (GUI) crafted using PyQt5 and OpenCV.
