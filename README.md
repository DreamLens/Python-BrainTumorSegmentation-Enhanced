In the arena of medical imaging, computer vision has emerged as a diverting force, transforming the way diagnostic data is interpreted. One such application employs advanced image processing techniques to deliver precise tumor segmentation from 2D MRI scans. This innovative approach is facilitated by a Python-oriented graphical user interface (GUI) crafted using PyQt5 and OpenCV.

The image processing sequence features several steps:
1. **Selective Insights:** Selecting the image for segmentation.
2. **Bilateral Refinement:** Leveraging a bilateral filter to retain details and suppress noise.
3. **Median Transformation:** Deploying a median filter to refinement the image while keeping crucial structures untouched.
4. **Gaussian Symphony:** Adding a Gaussian filter to blend and enhance the image's contours.
5. **Thresholded Precision:** Utilizing thresholding to highlight the image's critical features.
6. **Dilation and Morphology:** Applying dilation and morphological operations for deep analyzation.
7. **Color Mapping Elegance:** Incorporating a color map to create a vivid image for better interpretation.
8. **Preserving the Epiphany:** Saving the final, segmented image for further consultations and references.
